<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**Unsupervised Machine Learning - Task 2** is a core Data Science exploration conducted under the **Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP)** at **The Sparks Foundation**. The project focuses on the **Iris Dataset** to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent them visually.

By leveraging the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm, the system iteratively partitions data points into $K$ distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

### Computational Objectives
The analysis is governed by strict **exploratory principles** ensuring cluster validity:
*   **Elbow Method**: Determining the optimal value of $K$ by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).
*   **Cluster Centroids**: Computing the central vector for each species group.
*   **Dimensionality Visualization**: Plotting the classified clusters in a 2D feature space.

> [!TIP]
> **Algorithm Sensitivity**: K-Means clustering assumes spherical clusters of similar density. Given the slight overlap between *Versicolor* and *Virginica* classes, the algorithm's performance highlights the importance of feature scaling and centroid initialization in density-based separation tasks.

## Features

| Component | Technical Description |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Ingestion Pipeline** | Automated data retrieval and parsing using **Pandas** for the Iris dataset. |
| **Optimal K Selection** | Implementation of the **Elbow Method** to minimize WCSS/Inertia. |
| **Model Architecture** | application of `KMeans` from **Scikit-Learn** for centroid initialization and fitting. |
| **Visualization** | Scatter plotting of clusters and centroids using **Matplotlib**. |
| **Cluster Prediction** | Assigning new sample points to the nearest established cluster. |

> [!NOTE]
> ### Empirical Context
> The dataset comprises multivariate floral attributes (Sepal/Petal dimensions). The distinct separation of species in the feature space justifies the use of **K-Means Clustering** to identify inherent groupings without labeled supervision. The **Elbow Method** empirically validates $K=3$ as the optimal cluster count, aligning perfectly with the known biological taxonomy of the Iris species.

### Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Python 3.x
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**: Required for runtime execution. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Jupyter Environment**: For interactive code execution (JupyterLab or Notebook).

> [!WARNING]
> **Data Path Integrity**
>
> The analysis kernel relies on relative file paths. Ensure `Iris.csv` remains accessible to the notebook. Modifying the directory structure without updating the ingestion logic will result in `FileNotFoundError` during runtime.

### 2. Installation
Establish the local environment by cloning the repository and installing the computational stack:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/TSF-UNSUPERVISED-MACHINE-LEARNING.git
cd TSF-UNSUPERVISED-MACHINE-LEARNING

# Install clustering dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 3. Execution
Launch the analysis kernel to reproduce the findings:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Source Code/TSF_INTERNSHIP_TASK_2_UNSUPERVISED_LEARNING.ipynb"
```

> [!TIP]
